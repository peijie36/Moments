# INFO 340 Project

This repository contains code for an interactive information web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool. Collaborated with Scott Nguyen and Blake Liao

## Problem/Data Domain

One of the issues that new photographers and artists face nowadays is the lack of platforms to promote their
work via photo/art sharing. These groups of people tend to struggle with gaining popularity and audience
attention. They have to spend a lot of time and effort just to grow little by little in their passion or
career. There are many extraordinary photographers/artists who do not have their work appreciated enough.
With this web application, we hope to not only help discover talented photographers, but also draw in more
audiences to appreciate the exciting work in this field.

Having such a platform allows people to share their photos/artworks not only to the people around them, but
            also people from the internet if they choose to make their work public. One key information problem that a
            photo gallery website tries to address is the obstacles between artists
            and potential viewers of their artworks. Through the process of “following”, “liking”, and other
            interactions, the passion of the artists can be
            further stimulated, and meanwhile fulfills the need for art “hunting”. The majority of existing gallery
            websites only focus on the pictures, but rarely emphasize the creators of these works. As we want to resolve
            obstacles and bridge the gap between
            artists and users, we will create a gallery website that brings more recognition to the authors of their
            work.
            
## App Description

we want to center our website around photography and digital art. Specifically, we
            want to design a web application as a platform for avid artists, photographers, and creators to share their
            portfolios which can be viewed by other users interacting with our application. Users of this web
            application include photographers, artists, and people who are interested in viewing them. Because this web
            application relies on users uploading photos/artworks, it is considered a data collection website in which
            these uploaded photos/artworks are the information presented.
            
## Functionalities
 Uploading: users can choose to upload any photos and artworks to be shared with the public.
 
 Gallery view: users can browse photos/artworks in a feed page with the option to filter by tags.
                        Additionally, they can search specific users by usernames to view their profiles and portfolios.
